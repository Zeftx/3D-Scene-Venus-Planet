# 2D Snake Game with OpenGL

This is a 3D visualization project developed in C++ using OpenGL for a Computer Graphics course. 
The project features a rotating 3D model of the planet Venus with textures and interactive camera controls. 
The goal of this project was to demonstrate the use of OpenGL to render 3D objects, apply transformations, and handle user input for interactive visualizations.
The scene was developed step by step using OpenGL, based on tutorials from the official site.

# Features

- 3D model of the planet Venus rendered using OpenGL.
- Interactive camera controls for zooming and rotating the scene.
- Real-time updates and transformations (e.g., rotation, tilt).
- Texture mapping for a realistic appearance of Venus' surface.
- Smooth camera movements and auto-rotation toggle.
